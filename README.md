============
**This is my version of the project below**


SDSU MIS515 Java project 3 from Dr. Alexis Koster
MIS 515 â€“ Fall 2014.  Java Programming assignment #3.  Due:  December 5


Objectives: Superclasses and subclasses.  Abstract classes. inheritance and polymorphism

The previous program will be modified as follows

1.There are two types of accounts: Savings and Checking.  These will be subclasses of an abstract class Account

2. Methods of the class Account: relevant get and set methods; addDeposit method (add  deposit to the balance);  subtractWithdrawal (subtract  withdrawal from balance); printStatement(); maybe some of the other methods you already have;
abstract method: computeAverageBalance();

New fields of Account (instance variable) of the class Account: averageBalance,

Old fields: most of the fields as in assignment #3

3. Class Savings
  new fields: interest_rate (double) (will be 0.05 for all savings)
                    interest (the interest earned during the 30-day month)

 methods: printStatement() 
                 computeAverageBalance();
                    for a savings account,  the average balance for a given month is computed by     
                    method computeAverageBalance() as the half sum of the balances on the first day 
                     and last day of the month (before application of fees)"                
                   computeInterest(): interest rate times the average balance divided by 12
        .       
                 there are no fees on a Savings account

4. Class Checking

     new fields: 
 totalFee (see below)

     methods: printStatement()
                     computeAverageBalance()
                           for a checking account, the average balance is computed by method 
                            computeAverageBalance() as the half sum of the lowest and highest balances 
                             during the month                    
                         computeFee()
                             Fees: totalFee is computed by the method computeFee() as follows:
                                    Regular customers pay a monthly fee of $15 fee  
                                          If the averageBalance is less than 500, there is an extra fee:  $20 for 
                                            Regular customers, $10 for Premier Customer



5.  Test program requirements
First read customer information and set the array of Customers as in program3.

Then read account information and set one array of Account.  Note that each element of the array of Account will refer to either a Checking object or a Savings object.  This is polymorphism (see section 10.5 of Chapter10).


Then, for each account, as relevant, execute the following methods (again: invoked from the test program):
computeAverage(); computInterest(); computeFee (); printStatement()

Although this is not necessarily the best way to design such a program, I want to see at least those four methods invoked by the test program in order to illustrate the various types of methods in a hierarchy of classes and to illustrate polymorphism.
